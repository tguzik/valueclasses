# typedvalues [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tguzik/typedvalues.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tguzik/typedvalues)

**Please note that this is still work in progress **

This small library aims to make it easier to create values with separate type in Java. This is useful for protecting
against null values and retaining the information about what is expected to be passed as an argument... or at least
more readable than five String arguments in a row to some function ;-)

## How do I get it?

At this moment the library is available only through sources. Maven artifact is TBD.


## So what's inside?

TBD.

## Dependencies

This project depends on following third party libraries:

* `com.google.guava:guava`, version 16.0+
* `org.apache.commons:commons-lang3`, version 3.1+
* `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305`, version 2.0.2+
* `junit:junit`, version 4.11+
