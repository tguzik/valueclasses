/**
 * Base class for data objects that need to be performance aware. Compared to

 * {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} instead of relying on
 * reflection mechanisms.
 * <br>
 * The assumption is that method {@link #toString()} is called infrequently and
 * can still rely on reflection mechanisms. If you need this function to be
 * faster, please provide your own implementation (basing the implementation on
 * {@link StringBuilder} is recommended).
